# 21CW Oceans Team Collaborative Research Project

What is our ambition in the ocean space? Will we treat the ocean just as the key ingredient to circulations and weather that it is, or do we want to study “ocean weather” in its own right?

We want to work together on a specific research topic (to be determined). This central repository allows us to discuss project ideas, work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures, etc. 


# How it works

All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task. The first key issue is to list [Project Ideas](https://github.com/PaulSpence/21CW_Ocean_Collab/issues/1). What do we want to work on together?

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/users/PaulSpence/projects/3/views/1) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) at various stages.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).

# Meeting schedule

TBD - Hackathon (not a regular meeting) where we actively report on progress and work on this research every two weeks for 1-2 hrs.
