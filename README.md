# 21CW Oceans Team Collaborative Research Project

We want to work together on a specific research topic (to be determined). This central repository allows us to discuss project ideas, work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures, etc. 


# How it works

All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task. The first key issue is what do we want to work on together?

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/users/PaulSpence/projects/2)) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) at various stages.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).

As we figure out the main results and develop the storyline, we can add to the [Results Summary here](https://github.com/PaulSpence/MISO_PO/blob/main/Results_Summary.md) and draft figure list for the paper here.
