# 21CW Oceans Team Collaborative Research Project

This central repository allows us to discuss project ideas, work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures, etc.  


# How it works

All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/users/PaulSpence/projects/2)) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) at various stages.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).

As we figure out the main results and develop the storyline, we can add to the [Results Summary here](https://github.com/PaulSpence/MISO_PO/blob/main/Results_Summary.md) and draft figure list for the paper here.

# Short summary of results

**(AABW)**

**S1**- Contrasting to a freshening rebound due to an increase in salty Ross Sea bottom water progating west from 150E in the late 2010's, the AABW salinity in 140 and 150E is at the  early 2010's level somewhat reducing from the late 2010's. This indicates the salinity rebound has peaked out.
